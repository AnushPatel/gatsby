### What is a Site Map?

There are actually a couple of different types of sitemaps, such as a visual one that you can create before building a website, but we’re going to focus on the one that is most important for SEO.

This is known as an [XML sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en). It’s simply a list of the pages on your website.

Think of it as a map for your website. It shows what all of the pages are on your website.

### Install

To generate a XML sitemap, We will use the [gatsby-plugin-sitemap](/packages/gatsby-plugin-sitemap/) Package, To install this package, Run the following line on your command line:
   npm install --save gatsby-plugin-sitemap
