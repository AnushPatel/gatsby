### What is a Site Map?

There are actually a couple of different types of sitemaps, such as a visual one that you can create before building a website, but we’re going to focus on the one that is most important for SEO.

This is known as an [XML sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en). It’s simply a list of the pages on your website.

Think of it as a map for your website. It shows what all of the pages are on your website.

### Prerequisites (if any)

If applicable, list any prerequisites to reading and understanding your article. Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

### The facts

What are the facts you know about the topic of this guide?

Keep paragraphs short (around 1-4 sentences). People are more likely to read
several short paragraphs instead of a huge block of text.

### Example

Readers will likely use doc articles as a quick reference to look up syntax.
Articles should have a basic, real-world example that shows common use cases of its syntax.

Provide at least one example of how the task gets accomplished. A code snippet is ideal, in this format:

### Gatsby advantages

Does Gatsby address this topic uniquely in some way? If so, state the unique advantages Gatsby provides to the user.

If there are disadvantages Gatsby has, state those here as well and any known bugs or issues the Gatsby community is working on.

### Other resources

If there are other resources you think readers would benefit from or next steps they might want to take after reading your article, add
them at the bottom in an "Other Resources" section. You can also mention here any resources that helped you write the article (blogposts, outside tutorials, etc.).

- Link to a blogpost
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
